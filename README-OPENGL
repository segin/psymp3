ADDENUM FOR PSYMP3, VERSION 1.0.4
OPENGL INFORMATION
=================================

If PsyMP3 is compiled with the __FBGL__ marco defined, then
PsyMP3 will compiled and linked against the (included) fbgl 
library, and your system's OpenGL libraries. If your system 
has a 3D card (and I honestly can't see why it shouldn't), 
then the entire display will be hardware-accelerated.
