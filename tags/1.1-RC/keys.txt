PsyMP3 is almost completely keyboard-controlled. Below is a list of all 
commands and their associated keys:

"Q" or "ESC":     This command closes PsyMP3. Using the graphics window's
                  close button acts like you pressed a key that doesn't exist
                  on your keyboard, and that also closes the window.

"A":              Displays the about box (multiple presses to the main
                  window will give you multiple boxes to play with :)
                  
"S":              Spectrum analyzer on/off. On even a decently modern box,
                  PsyMP3 sucks about 10% CPU just for the graphics.

"R":              Restarts the song.

"L":              Loads a new song. If you press this by accident, 
                  merely dismiss the file chooser dialog to cancel.
                  
"E":              Does nothing useful for the end-user, was meant to test
                  FMOD functionality.

"B":              Toggles Repeat Track mode, where it loops the song.

"Z":              Displays a framerate counter.

"Space":          Pauses/Plays the song

"Left":           Goes back by 1.5 seconds (hold down to seek)

"Right":          Goes forward by 1.5 seconds (hold down to seek)
