ADDENDUM FOR PSYMP3 README, FOR GNU/LINUX AND FREEBSD
Version 1.0.4

Installing on Linux:

Since there is no single directory on a user's system guarnteed to exist and contain
TrueType fonts, there is thus no system-wide directory I can suggest you use to install
vera.ttf; PsyMP3 will look in the current working directory and ~/.fonts.

Make sure that libfmod.so is in your library path, coping it to either /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib
should do it.

NOTE: PsyMP3 seems to use several hundred megabytes of memory when running.
It is not known if this is a FMOD problem, a compiler problem, or a 
memory allocation problem of PsyMP3. This problem doesn't appear on Windows, so
it is a good guess that my build of FMOD has a memory leak, but I am too lazy
to run it through Valgrind to debug it. The memory usage is more severe the 
longer that PsyMP3 runs.
