ADDENDUM FOR PSYMP3 README, FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND REACTOS
Version 1.0.4

IMPORTANT: You MUST have the file zlib1.dll, fmod.dll, and freetype6.dll either in
%systemroot%\System32 or the directory in which PsyMP3's executable resides.

PsyMP3 uses the BitStream Vera Sans font, which must be in either %systemroot%\Fonts
or the directory in which PsyMP3 was installed. Note that PsyMP3 is able to dectect
the exact location of your Windows installation, irregardless of what it is named or on
what drive it is installed. This is accomplished via the GetWindowsDirectory() function,
so if windows is installed in G:\OS\NT, then PsyMP3 will look for G:\OS\NT\Fonts\vera.ttf.

If BitStream Vera Sans is not installed, or the file is not correctly named, then the 
font Tahoma will be used. PsyMP3 only checks %systemroot%\Fonts for Tahoma.
