/**
 * @brief A Widget is a UI element that can be rendered to a surface and handle mouse events.
 * 
 * The Widget class serves as the foundation for the UI toolkit, providing hierarchical composition,
 * event handling, and rendering capabilities. Widgets can contain child widgets, creating complex
 * UI structures with proper event delegation and layered rendering.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Hierarchical composition with parent-child relationships
 * - Mouse event handling with capture and transparency support
 * - Surface-based rendering with automatic child widget blitting
 * - Position and bounds management
 * - Move semantics for efficient widget management
 * 
 * @see DrawableWidget for widgets that require custom drawing
 * @see LayoutWidget for container widgets without subclassing
