 * @brief Root widget that covers the entire SDL window and manages all UI elements.
 * 
 * This widget acts as the top-level container for all UI elements in the application.
 * It fills the entire SDL window and manages:
 * - The background/desktop UI (spectrum analyzer, controls, etc.)
 * - Window widgets (which appear on top of the background)
 * - Global mouse and keyboard event routing
 * - Z-order management for windows
 * 
 * This is a singleton class - only one ApplicationWidget can exist at a time.
