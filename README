README FOR PSYMP3 2-CURRENT
===========================

===========================

1. OVERVIEW

PsyMP3 is a simplistic audio media player with a flashy Fourier transform.
PsyMP3 2.x is a radical departure from the code of the 1.x series. Whereas
1.x was written in FreeBASIC, 2.x is written in C++, and is portable!

The "2-CURRENT" version tag represents the "bleeding edge" of development.
End users shouldn't be using this; please use the last version tagged as
-RELEASE. -CURRENT means "This is what I am working on, in whatever state
it happens to be in, complete or not."

You can reach me at <segin2005@gmail.com>.

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

   Windows:
   Windows 10 or later. Windows 7 through 8.1 might work, YMMV.

   Linux, *BSD:
	The following dependencies are required:
	 SDL 1.2 or later
	 libmpg123 1.8 or later
	 taglib 1.6 or later
     libvorbisfile 1.3 or later
     libvorbis
     libopusfile 0.9 or later
     libopus
     libogg
     libFLAC++ 1.2 or later
     libFLAC
     FreeType 2.4 or later
     OpenSSL 1.0 or later
     D-Bus 1.0 or later (optional, for MPRIS support)
     
   macOS:
	Not officially supported, but building the dependencies for Linux/BSD with MacPorts might work.

   Building from git requires autoconf-archive for the extended macros.

3. USAGE

Pass the paths to the audio files to be played as program arguments.
Supported formats include MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, FLAC, and RIFF WAVE.
Audio files will be played in the order they are passed on the command line.
All user interaction, aside from clicking the 'close' button for the window, is done via the keyboard.

Keys and what they do:
  * ESC and Q: Quit PsyMP3.
  * Space: Pause (or resume) playback.
  * R: Restart the current track from the beginning
  * N: Seek to the next track.
  * P: Seek to the previous track.

Command-line Options:
  --debug             Enable debug logging to the console.
  --logfile <file>    Write debug logs to the specified file.

Last.fm Scrobbling:

PsyMP3 includes built-in Last.fm scrobbling support to automatically track your music listening history.

To enable Last.fm scrobbling, create a configuration file:
  * Linux/Unix: ~/.config/psymp3/lastfm.conf
  * Windows: %APPDATA%\PsyMP3\lastfm.conf

Configuration file format:
  # Last.fm configuration
  username=your_lastfm_username
  password=your_lastfm_password

Once configured, PsyMP3 will automatically:
  * Submit "Now Playing" status when you start a track
  * Scrobble tracks after you've listened to >50% or >4 minutes (whichever comes first)
  * Only scrobble tracks longer than 30 seconds
  * Cache scrobbles offline and submit when connection is restored

For detailed Last.fm setup and troubleshooting, see the included LASTFM_SETUP.md file.

4. NOTES

At this time, PsyMP3 2.x is incomplete. There's very little UI code, and most
features are missing at this time. If you are a developer, and are interested
in helping me, please email me above.

If you are an end user and you don't like this program, feel free to use
something else, and check back later for improvements

Unicode ID3 tags are supported. Please replace the included 'vera.ttf' with a different
font file containing the Unicode glpyhs you desire. Advanced text layout is not supported
(e.g. connected Arabic characters.)
