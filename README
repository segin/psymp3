README FOR PSYMP3 2-CURRENT
===========================

===========================

1. OVERVIEW

PsyMP3 is a simplistic audio media player with a flashy Fourier transform.
PsyMP3 2.x is a radical departure from the code of the 1.x series. Whereas
1.x was written in FreeBASIC, 2.x is written in C++, and is portable!

The "2-CURRENT" version tag represents the "bleeding edge" of development.
End users shouldn't be using this; please use the last version tagged as
-RELEASE. -CURRENT means "This is what I am working on, in whatever state
it happens to be in, complete or not."

You can reach me at <segin2005@gmail.com>.

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

   Windows:
   Windows 10 or later. Windows 7 through 8.1 might work, YMMV.

   Linux, *BSD:
	The following dependencies are required:
	 SDL 1.2 or later
	 mpg123-1.8 or later
	 taglib-1.6 or later
     libvorbisfile
     libvorbis
     libopusfile
     libopus
     libogg
     libFLAC++
     libFLAC
     FreeType 2.4 or later
     SDL_ttf 1.2 or later
     zlib-1.2.3 or later
     
   Mac OS X:
	Not officially supported, but building the dependencies for Linux/BSD with MacPorts might work.

   Building from git requires autoconf-archive for the extended macros.

3. USAGE

Pass the paths to the MP3s, Ogg Vorbis, or Opus files to be played as program arguments.
Audio files will be played in the order they are passed on the command line.
All user interaction, aside from clicking the 'close' button for the window, is done via the keyboard.

Keys and what they do:
  * ESC and Q: Quit PsyMP3.
  * Space: Pause (or resume) playback.
  * R: Restart the current track from the beginning
  * N: Seek to the next track.
  * P: Seek to the previous track.

4. NOTES

At this time, PsyMP3 2.x is incomplete. There's very little UI code, and most
features are missing at this time. If you are a developer, and are interested
in helping me, please email me above.

If you are an end user and you don't like this program, feel free to use
something else, and check back later for improvements

Unicode ID3 tags are supported. Please replace the included 'vera.ttf' with a different
font file containing the Unicode glpyhs you desire. Advanced text layout is not supported
(e.g. connected Arabic characters.)
