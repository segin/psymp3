        std::string operation;
        std::chrono::nanoseconds duration;
        std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point timestamp;
        size_t thread_id;
        bool lock_contention;
    };
    
    struct Statistics {
        std::chrono::nanoseconds min_duration, max_duration;
        std::chrono::nanoseconds avg_duration, median_duration;
        std::chrono::nanoseconds p95_duration, p99_duration;
        size_t total_calls, contention_events;
