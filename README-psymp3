1. OVERVIEW

PsyMP3 is a general, all-round, simple media player. PsyMP3 was named
for the bar spectrum visualization, which is a simple psychovisual display.

System Requirements:
	* WINDOWS AND REACTOS:
	- Microsoft Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, and Server 2003
	  (Vista and Server 2008 support not guarnteed -- Windows 7 support 
	  guarnteed not to exist when Windows 7 does come out)
	- ReactOS 0.3 or later
	- Intel Pentium-MMX processor or AMD K6, 200MHz or better
	- 800x600 16-bit SVGA or better (a ultra high-end 512MB PCI-E 16x card
	  WILL NOT make this run any better)
	- An additional 32MB of system RAM over your OS's requirement 
	  (128MB is good)
	- 1MB of disk space
	- 16-bit sound card (just about every sound card made in the last 15
	  years will work)
	- FMOD 3.7x (included with PsyMP3)
	- FreeType 2 (included with PsyMP3)
	
	* GNU/LINUX:
	- Linux 2.4.16 or later (Older kernels will work, but why bother?)
	- FMOD 3.7x (a copy of libfmod.so is included with PsyMP3)
	- ALSA 0.9x or Open Sound System drivers (If the OSS on FreeBSD
	  when running a Linux binary of PsyMP3 under FreeBSD doesn't work,
	  this is a BUG)
	- GTK+-2.4 or later (you can probably get away with older)
	- a working X11 installation OR
	- A working Linux framebuffer with at least 24-bit color 
	- In either case, you still need Xlib and other base X libraries
	- 1GB of RAM (2GB is better, see README-Linux for why)
	- an i386 machine with a 400MHz CPU would be nice, 200MHz minimum

2. USAGE

PsyMP3 is a simple media player; in fact, it has very few features.
If PsyMP3 is started without any command-line arguments, you will be 
prompted for a filename by your OS's standard file selection dialog.
If there are any command-line arguments, PsyMP3 will simply take the first
argument and treat it as the path to a file to play.

When playback of the selected media is complete, PsyMP3 will terminate

When playing, PsyMP3 is controlled entirely by keyboard.

Your keys are:
	SPACE	  - This pauses and resumes playback
	ESC or Q  - These close PsyMP3
	LEFT	  - This rewinds playback, 1.5 seconds at a time
	RIGHT	  - This fastforwards playback, 1.5 seconds at a time

email for more than a year, and I lack a home Internet connection with which
to do so.

4. NOTES
Starting with PsyMP3 1.0.6, we are going to try to stop using the FMOD sound
 library. FMOD is proprietary and thus sucks.
