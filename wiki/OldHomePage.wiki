<g:plusone size="medium">+1 PsyMP3 on Google+!</g:plusone>

PsyMP3 is an audio media player written in C++, sporting a simple, minimalistic, and keyboard-driven user interface.

Previously written in FreeBASIC, I have decided to rewrite the entire program in portable C++, enabling ports to *GNU/Linux, [http://www.freebsd.org/ Free]/[http://www.openbsd.org/ Open]/[http://www.netbsd.org/ Net]BSD, [http://www.apple.com/macosx/ Mac OS X], [http://www.oracle.com/solaris Solaris] (and it's open-source derivative, [http://openindiana.org/ OpenIndiana]), and anything else I can get my hands on*.

So far, PsyMP3 2.x is in development, The 2-CURRENT source is currently at the completeness level of a pre-alpha technical demonstration. As such, it's not very useful yet. It's somewhat buggy, and requires special tricks to start up. But, it does work and is a stepping stone to a full-fledged portable PsyMP3 on many OSes.

= Everything Below This Line Is Outdated. 1.x Information only: = 

There is support for sending "Now Playing" to MSN Messenger (or pidgin-musictracker or aMSN), remote control via the Winamp remote-control interface (e.g. FoxyTunes, the Winamp toolbar, etc.), basic playlist support (more to come), and other side features.

Features to date include:
  * Will send "Now Playing" information to MSN Messenger, pidgin-musictracker (when configured to "Messenger compatible"), and aMSN's Music plugin. Possibly others. 
  * Supports being remote-controlled by things like the FoxyTunes plugin for Firefox. Tell it that PsyMP3 is actually Winamp. No song title/artist/album yet.
  * Last.fm Scrobbler support - supports "now playing", client ID, scrobble caching.

In the latest builds of PsyMP3 (later than July 5th), create a file named
"lastfm_config.txt" in the PsyMP3 program directory, and on the first line, put your username, on the second line, put you password. The file should look like this:

{{{
someuser
mypass32
}}}

*NOTE TO GNU/LINUX, *BSD, ETC. USERS:* PsyMP3 running in Wine will NOT announce itself to native messengers. If you REALLY want this feature to work on Linux, run Pidgin in Wine, or do without.

Works out of the box with Windows Live Messenger.

Pidgin users: Make sure you have [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-musictracker/ pidgin-musictracker] installed and set it to use the "Messenger compatible" interface.

Make sure that the "Swap artist and title" checkbox under "Properties" is DISABLED.
