= Introduction =

Pidgin-musictracker is a plugin for Pidgin (and possibly other libpurple-based messengers) that allows for Pidgin users to get the "Now Playing" information from a number of different media players. It is cross-platform and open-source.


= Details =

PsyMP3 supports the "Messenger compatible" interface of pidgin-musictracker. This interface implements a hidden MsnMsgrUiManager window, for which WM_COPYDATA messages are sent to update the status as seen by pidgin-musictracker.

PsyMP3 also supports a subset of the Winamp IPC interface. Pidgin-musictracker is therefore able to retrieve the artist, song title, album, song length, and current position in the currently playing song, using the Winamp IPC interface.
