= Introduction =

Pidgin-musictracker is a plugin for Pidgin (and possibly other libpurple-based messengers) that allows for Pidgin users to get the "Now Playing" information from a number of different media players. It is cross-platform and open-source.


= Details =

PsyMP3 supports the "Messenger compatible" interface of pidgin-musictracker. This interface implements a hidden MsnMsgrUiManager window, for which WM_COPYDATA messages are sent to update the status as seen by pidgin-musictracker.

PsyMP3 also supports a subset of the Winamp IPC interface. Missing is support for getting the artist, song title, and album of the currently playing song. Pidgin-musictracker is, however, able to retrieve the song length, and current position in the song, using the Winamp IPC interface.

PsyMP3, however, does not implement this part of the Winamp IPC interface, and pidgin-musictracker is only able to retrieve the song length and current position.
