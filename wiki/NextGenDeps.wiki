= Introduction =

A list of dependencies in the C++ PsyMP3 2.x. List edited when I feel like it.

= Dependecies =

Non-exaustive:
  * SDL
  * SDL_gfx
  * SDL_ttf
  * TagLib
  * libmpg123
  * libogg
  * libvorbis
  * vorbisfile
  * libvisual-0.4
  * a working C++ compiler

== Dependency Installation on Debian and Ubuntu ==

You'll need to install these packages:
  * build-essential (this one is a no-brainer) 
  * libsdl1.2-dev
  * libsdl-gfx1.2-dev
  * libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
  * libtag1-dev
  * libmpg123-dev
  * libogg-dev
  * libvorbis-dev
  * libvisual-0.4-dev

On the command line, you can easily install with: 

{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libtag1-dev libmpg123-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libvisual-0.4-dev
