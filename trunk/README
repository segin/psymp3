README FOR PSYMP3 2-CURRENT
===========================

 1. Overview
 2. System Requirements
 3. Notes

===========================

1. OVERVIEW

PsyMP3 is a simplistic audio media player with a flashy Fourier transform.
PsyMP3 2.x is a radical departure from the code of the 1.x series. Whereas
1.x was written in FreeBASIC, 2.x is written in C++, and is portable!

The "2-CURRENT" version tag represents the "bleeding edge" of development.
End users shouldn't be using this; please use the last version tagged as
-RELEASE. -CURRENT means "This is what I am working on, in whatever state
it happens to be in, complete or not."

You can reach me at <segin2005@gmail.com>.

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

   Windows NT:
	NT 4.0 or later, Windows 2000 recommended
	Minimum CPU isn't known currently, 1GHz Pentium III is my current guess
	64MB of RAM, not counting your OS configuration or other software.
	DirectDraw-accelerated drivers help.

   Linux, *BSD:
	glibc-2.3 or later, FreeBSD 6, NetBSD 4, or OpenBSD 3.5 or later recommended.
	Older releases may or may not work; please email your results!
	X11 is recommended, or an SDL compiled to use some other graphics output.
	POSIX threads. On Linux, NTPL is recommended (requires kernel 2.6.9 or later)

   Mac OS X:
	Windows installed in Boot Camp, or Darwine
	An Intel CPU is probably also required, although PowerPC might work later on.

3. NOTES

At this time, PsyMP3 2.x is incomplete. There's very little UI code, and most
features are missing at this time. If you are a developer, and are interested
in helping me, please email me above.

If you are an end user and you don't like this program, feel free to use
something else.

At this current time, you need to provide it exactly one argument; the path to a
valid mp3 file. Failure to comply will result in a crash :) You have been warned.
