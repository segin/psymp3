# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical threading safety issues in the PsyMP3 codebase where public API methods that acquire resource locks can cause deadlocks when called from other public lock-acquiring methods within the same class. The solution involves implementing a consistent pattern where every public lock-acquiring method has a corresponding private non-locking version, and updating project steering documents to enforce this pattern going forward.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the PsyMP3 codebase, I want all classes with resource locks to follow a consistent threading pattern, so that I can avoid deadlocks when calling public methods from within the same class.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a class has public methods that acquire locks THEN it SHALL also provide private versions of those methods that do not acquire locks
2. WHEN a public method needs to call another method in the same class THEN it SHALL call the private non-locking version to prevent deadlock
3. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all classes that use mutex locks, spinlocks, or other synchronization primitives
4. WHEN analyzing lock usage THEN the system SHALL detect public methods that acquire locks and verify they have private non-locking counterparts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the PsyMP3 codebase, I want comprehensive documentation of the threading safety patterns, so that future development follows consistent practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating steering documents THEN they SHALL include clear guidelines for implementing thread-safe public/private method pairs
2. WHEN documenting threading patterns THEN the guidelines SHALL specify naming conventions for private non-locking methods
3. WHEN creating new threaded code THEN developers SHALL follow the established lock acquisition patterns
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN the threading safety guidelines SHALL be easily accessible and enforceable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging threading issues, I want all existing deadlock-prone code patterns to be identified and fixed, so that the application runs reliably in multithreaded environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning existing code THEN the system SHALL identify all public methods that acquire locks without private counterparts
2. WHEN fixing threading issues THEN each problematic method SHALL be refactored to follow the public/private lock pattern
3. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all internal method calls SHALL use private non-locking versions
4. WHEN testing threading fixes THEN the system SHALL verify that deadlock conditions are eliminated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with specific subsystems, I want threading safety fixes to be prioritized based on subsystem criticality, so that the most important components are addressed first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prioritizing fixes THEN audio processing and streaming components SHALL be addressed first
2. WHEN analyzing subsystems THEN demuxers, codecs, and I/O handlers SHALL be given high priority
3. WHEN scheduling fixes THEN UI components SHALL be addressed after core audio functionality
4. WHEN implementing fixes THEN each subsystem SHALL maintain its existing public API contracts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code quality, I want automated verification of threading safety patterns, so that future code changes don't reintroduce deadlock risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing threading patterns THEN the code SHALL include clear documentation of lock acquisition order
2. WHEN adding new threaded methods THEN they SHALL follow the established public/private pattern
3. WHEN building the project THEN threading safety violations SHALL be detectable through static analysis where possible
4. WHEN updating the build system THEN it SHALL include checks for common threading anti-patterns
