# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification) implementation in PsyMP3 has several issues that make it a source of crashes and instability as changes are made to the codebase. The implementation lacks proper error handling, thread safety, resource management, and follows outdated patterns that don't align with modern C++ practices or the project's established threading safety guidelines.

This refactoring aims to create a robust, maintainable, and crash-resistant MPRIS implementation that follows the project's threading safety patterns, provides comprehensive error handling, and integrates cleanly with the existing Player architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a PsyMP3 user, I want MPRIS integration to work reliably without causing crashes, so that I can control playback through desktop media controls and third-party applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MPRIS subsystem encounters D-Bus errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing the application
2. WHEN D-Bus connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection and continue functioning
3. WHEN MPRIS methods are called concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle them thread-safely without deadlocks
4. WHEN the Player state changes THEN MPRIS SHALL reliably update external clients with current status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a PsyMP3 developer, I want the MPRIS code to follow established threading safety patterns, so that it doesn't introduce deadlocks or race conditions when Player code is modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MPRIS methods acquire locks THEN they SHALL follow the public/private lock pattern with _unlocked methods
2. WHEN MPRIS accesses Player state THEN it SHALL use proper lock acquisition order to prevent deadlocks
3. WHEN MPRIS callbacks are invoked THEN they SHALL not hold internal locks to prevent callback-induced deadlocks
4. WHEN multiple MPRIS operations occur simultaneously THEN they SHALL be properly synchronized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a PsyMP3 developer, I want MPRIS resource management to be automatic and exception-safe, so that D-Bus resources are properly cleaned up even when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MPRIS is initialized THEN all D-Bus resources SHALL be managed with RAII patterns
2. WHEN exceptions occur during MPRIS operations THEN all acquired resources SHALL be automatically released
3. WHEN the Player shuts down THEN MPRIS SHALL cleanly release all D-Bus connections and registrations
4. WHEN D-Bus operations fail THEN partial state SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a PsyMP3 user, I want MPRIS to provide complete media player functionality, so that all standard media control operations work correctly through desktop integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external applications query playback status THEN MPRIS SHALL return accurate current state
2. WHEN external applications request metadata THEN MPRIS SHALL provide complete track information
3. WHEN external applications send control commands THEN MPRIS SHALL execute them and update status accordingly
4. WHEN seeking operations are requested THEN MPRIS SHALL handle both absolute and relative positioning correctly### Requi

**User Story:** As a PsyMP3 developer, I want the MPRIS implementation to be modular and testable, so that it can be easily maintained and verified without requiring full application integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MPRIS components are designed THEN they SHALL have clear separation of concerns with testable interfaces
2. WHEN D-Bus message handling occurs THEN it SHALL be separated from Player state management for independent testing
3. WHEN MPRIS is disabled at build time THEN the Player SHALL function normally without MPRIS dependencies
4. WHEN MPRIS unit tests are written THEN they SHALL be able to mock D-Bus interactions for reliable testing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a PsyMP3 user, I want MPRIS to handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully, so that media control integration remains stable under all usage scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN D-Bus service is unavailable THEN MPRIS SHALL initialize gracefully and retry connection attempts
2. WHEN malformed D-Bus messages are received THEN MPRIS SHALL validate input and reject invalid requests safely
3. WHEN Player state is inconsistent THEN MPRIS SHALL provide sensible default responses to external queries
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN MPRIS SHALL degrade gracefully without affecting core playback functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a PsyMP3 developer, I want MPRIS logging and debugging to be comprehensive and configurable, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MPRIS operations occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels for debugging
2. WHEN D-Bus errors happen THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for troubleshooting
3. WHEN MPRIS is in debug mode THEN it SHALL provide detailed state and message tracing
4. WHEN production deployment occurs THEN MPRIS logging SHALL be configurable to avoid performance impact
