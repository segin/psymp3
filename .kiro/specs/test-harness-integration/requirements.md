# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PsyMP3 project currently has a collection of standalone experimental test files in the `tests/` directory that test various aspects of the Rect class and other components. These tests are currently isolated and lack a unified test harness for coordinated execution, reporting, and integration into the build system. This feature will create a comprehensive test harness that integrates all existing standalone tests into a cohesive testing framework with proper reporting, error handling, and build system integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified test harness that can discover and run all existing test cases, so that I can execute the entire test suite with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test harness is executed THEN it SHALL automatically discover all test files in the tests/ directory
2. WHEN test discovery occurs THEN the system SHALL identify test files based on the naming pattern `test_*.cpp`
3. WHEN the test harness runs THEN it SHALL execute each discovered test and collect results
4. WHEN all tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report showing passed/failed counts
5. IF any test fails THEN the harness SHALL return a non-zero exit code
6. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL preserve individual test output for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test harness to integrate with the existing GNU Autotools build system, so that tests can be built and executed as part of the standard development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test harness is built THEN it SHALL use the GNU Autotools infrastructure with Makefile.am as the source of truth
2. WHEN `make check` is executed THEN the system SHALL build all test executables and run the test harness
3. WHEN test compilation occurs THEN it SHALL use the same compiler flags and includes as defined in configure.ac
4. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL rebuild only affected test executables through autotools dependency tracking
5. IF the current tests/Makefile is not autotools-generated THEN it SHALL be refactored into a proper Makefile.am
6. WHEN tests are cleaned THEN the system SHALL remove all test executables and temporary files using `make clean`
7. WHEN autotools regeneration occurs THEN test configuration SHALL be included in the configure.ac and Makefile.am files

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system refactoring to clean up unused dependencies and improve dependency tracking, so that the build is more efficient and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configure.ac is refactored THEN unused dependencies like `opusfile` and `vorbisfile` SHALL be removed
2. WHEN dependency tracking is improved THEN the system SHALL only link libraries that are actually used by each component
3. WHEN the build system is updated THEN it SHALL use more precise dependency detection and configuration
4. IF libraries are not needed for core functionality THEN they SHALL be made optional or removed entirely
5. WHEN Makefile.am files are created THEN they SHALL follow autotools best practices for dependency management
6. WHEN the build is optimized THEN it SHALL reduce compilation time and improve incremental builds

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project documentation to be updated to reflect the new test harness and build system changes, so that other developers can understand and use the new testing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test harness is implemented THEN the README SHALL be updated with testing instructions
2. WHEN build system changes are made THEN the README SHALL document the new build and test procedures
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include examples of running tests with different options
4. IF new dependencies or build requirements are introduced THEN they SHALL be documented in the README
5. WHEN testing procedures change THEN the README SHALL provide clear migration guidance from old to new methods
6. WHEN the README is updated THEN it SHALL maintain consistency with the existing documentation style and format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed test reporting and logging, so that I can quickly identify and debug test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress indicators
2. WHEN a test passes THEN the system SHALL log a success message with test name and execution time
3. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL capture and display the failure output
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report showing all results
5. IF verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL display individual test function results
6. WHEN test output is captured THEN it SHALL preserve both stdout and stderr streams
7. WHEN reporting occurs THEN the system SHALL categorize results by test file and test function

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test harness to handle different types of test failures gracefully, so that one failing test doesn't prevent other tests from running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test executable crashes THEN the harness SHALL continue executing remaining tests
2. WHEN a test times out THEN the system SHALL terminate it and mark as failed
3. WHEN a test returns non-zero exit code THEN it SHALL be marked as failed but not stop execution
4. IF a test executable is missing THEN the system SHALL report it as a build failure
5. WHEN assertion failures occur THEN the system SHALL capture the assertion details
6. WHEN exceptions are thrown THEN the harness SHALL catch and report them appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test harness to support different execution modes, so that I can run tests in ways that suit different development scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `--verbose` flag is used THEN the system SHALL display detailed output from each test
2. WHEN `--filter` option is provided THEN the system SHALL run only tests matching the pattern
3. WHEN `--list` option is used THEN the system SHALL display all available tests without running them
4. WHEN `--parallel` option is specified THEN the system SHALL run independent tests concurrently
5. IF `--stop-on-failure` is enabled THEN the system SHALL halt execution on first test failure
6. WHEN `--output-format` is specified THEN the system SHALL support multiple report formats (text, XML, JSON)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing test code to be refactored to better integrate with the testing harness, so that tests are more maintainable and provide better reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are refactored THEN they SHALL use a common test framework structure for consistent reporting
2. WHEN test functions are organized THEN they SHALL be grouped logically and named consistently
3. WHEN test assertions are standardized THEN they SHALL provide clear failure messages and context
4. IF tests currently use different assertion patterns THEN they SHALL be unified under a common approach
5. WHEN test output is standardized THEN it SHALL provide structured information for the harness to parse
6. WHEN tests are refactored THEN they SHALL maintain their existing test coverage and functionality
7. WHEN common test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be extracted into shared helper functions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test harness to provide performance metrics, so that I can monitor test execution efficiency and identify slow tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL measure and report execution time for each test
2. WHEN test suite completes THEN the system SHALL report total execution time
3. WHEN performance data is collected THEN it SHALL identify the slowest running tests
4. IF a test exceeds a configurable timeout THEN the system SHALL terminate and report it
5. WHEN multiple runs occur THEN the system SHALL optionally track performance trends
6. WHEN reporting performance THEN the system SHALL include memory usage statistics if available
